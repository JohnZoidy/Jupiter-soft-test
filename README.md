# Jupiter soft test task

Based on my react-boilerplate package. Includes:

- Linter (ESlint);
- Babel;
- WebPack;
- Sass;
- Makefile;

So for use you just need to use commands:

1. Clone this repo:

2. Then move into repo directory and install dependencies:

```javascript
    make install
```

3. Run project at wevpack devSever (localhost:5500 as default in config):

```javascript
    make start
```

See other commands in makefile.
You can use similar commands by standart scripts in package.json.
